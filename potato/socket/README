This directory contains three files:

* Makefile
* listen.c
* speak.c

The Makefile creates two executables: listen and speak.  The Makefile
is set up for Solaris.  To compile in Linux, comment the indicated
line in Makefile.

The pair of programs are an example of a very simple socket program.
Execute the listen program first.  It will establish a port and wait
for another process to connect.  The speak program will connect to the
port established by listen.  Each line typed into speak will be sent
to listen, which echoes the text on its screen.

Terminate speak with a ^D.  Listen will hang around waiting for
another connection, which can come from the same machine or another.
Terminate listen with ^C.
